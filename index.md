# Julia for Deep Learning

A course repository to follow along fast.ai using [Julia](https://julialang.org)!

Welcome! Here’s where you can find all the information you’ll need on the course. The goal of these docs is to follow along with the course [fast.ai](https://fast.ai), a stellar deep learning course. fast.ai is implemented in Python, but I personally strongly prefer Julia, and have always wanted to learn more deep learning. 

We’ll be implementing the fast.ai tutorials in Julia and going through them collaboratively. Every two weeks we’ll assign some reading and personal exercises, and then meet to discuss pain points/implementations/etc. 

Check out our [GitHub](https://github.com/cpfiffer/julia-deeplearning) for more, and join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/zr5RVdWxs2)!
